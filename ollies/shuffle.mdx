title: 'Skate Shuffle'
---

Spin to interact with a random app from a different VM, powered by Skate. Collect Ollies on each spin.

## How to Guide
1. Connect your wallet. We currently support Backpack Wallet on Eclipse.
2. Spin to execute a random cross-VM transaction with a random app.
    - You will be prompted to pay a small amount to cover gas fees for the cross-VM transaction.
    - You can view the status of your cross-VM transaction under “Your Cross-VM Tasks” at the bottom of the page.
    - You will receive a random amount of Ollies depending on your spin results. This amount is boosted if you have purchased a Skate Visa.

## Ollies Earned
The amount of Ollies you earn is a function of your spin results.

There are 3 general outcomes:

1. No Match
2. Two of a Kind: Medium sized bonus
3. Three of a Kind: Large bonus

Each protocol logo has a unique multiplier associated with it. Try to go for 3 of a Kind Skate!
