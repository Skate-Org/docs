title: 'Skate Visa'
---

Skate Visa multiplies your Ollies, accelerates future earnings, and unlocks exclusive perks within the Skate ecosystem.

Purchasing a Skate Visa gives a significant one time Ollies bonus, our way of giving back to the community for supporting us.
Each Skatepark account **can only purchase 1 Visa**. The bonuses and multipliers only apply **once to each account**.
You may purchase a Visa from the SkatePark on Solana, Eclipse, TON, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Mantle.

## How Visa Multipliers Work?
Purchasing a visa will give you two multipliers. 

1. The first smaller multiplier will apply to your Testnet phase activities. 
    + This multiplier will apply to your Ollies earned from the Skate Rebel and Skateboard Workshop campaigns. 
    + This does not include referrals.

2. The second larger multiplier is applied to all of your mainnet activities on Skate. 
    + This includes interacting with any of our cross-VM apps like Polymarket on Eclipse and TON. 
    + This boost also applies to quests and check-ins on our Telegram mini-app.
