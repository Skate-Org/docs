title: 'Adoption of Othentic Stack'
---

Skate strategic adoption of [Othentic](https://x.com/0xOthentic) stack brings multiple advantages, which are [discussed here](/main/architecture/avs#avs-smart-contracts).

## Integration details

By leveraging Othentic, the AVS operators network is split up into four [roles](/operators/roles) with their specialized functionalities.

External operator will run (either of the four) node software to participate in Skate AVS. The TLDR for each role may be found [here](/main/architecture/avs#network-components).

The Attester and Aggregator software are maintained by Othentic while Skate develops the Performer software.
