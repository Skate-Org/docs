## Start an Aggregator

To start up an Aggregator node, one needs access to Othentic CLI and download Skate Aggregator extension package. Then start up the node by specifying the following options:

+ **Config**: contains essential information to boost up the node, e.g. jsonRPC server and p2p network ports, aggregator key, and Attestation chain RPC.
+ **Announce**: public dns in [multiaddr format](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/addressing/README.md) for other peers to reach this node, e.g. `/dns4/aggregator.avs.skatechain.org/tcp/6666`

### Network config

The machine on which the aggregator runs must expose the specified jsonRPC server and libp2p node process ports to the public domain. By default, the jsonRPC server starts on `:8545` and the libp2p node process starts on `:9876`.

A sample nginx config and set up instructions can be found in [Skate repo](https://github.com/Skate-Org/skate/avs) (restricted access)

### Metrics server

A metrics server will be spawning on `127.0.0.1:4001`, can be customized base on the input config. Node operators has to set up their own metrics analytics service, e.g. Grafana. Skate provides instructions and a default configuration for Grafana server.

### Task execution status

Execution status of all performers collected tasks can be queried from `https://task-server.avs.skatechain.org`
