## Start an Attester

To start up an Attester node, one needs access to Othentic CLI. Then start up the node by running with Othentic CLI with the following options:

+ **Bootstrap node**: the known peer, also the aggregator in [multiaddr format](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/addressing/README.md). This must by args\[1\] when invoking the CLI. Skate runs a default aggregator at `/dns4/aggregator.avs.skatechain.org/tcp/6666`.

+ **Avs web API**: Skate AVS WebAPI at `https://webapi.avs.skatechain.org` and port `443` for HTTPs.

### Metrics server

A metrics server will be spawning on `127.0.0.1:4002`, can be customized base on the input config. Node operators has to set up their own metrics analytics service, e.g. Grafana. Skate provides instructions and a default configuration for Grafana server.
