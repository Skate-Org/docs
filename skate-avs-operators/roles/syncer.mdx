## Responsiblity

Since attestation is performed on L2 while staking is managed by AVS Governance on L1, operator voting power (based on their stake) needs to be frequently synchronized.

Currently, Skate will oversee AVS and run our private syncer at 6 hours syncing frequency. Before the mainnet launch, we will transition this to a permissionless system with detailed incentive information.
