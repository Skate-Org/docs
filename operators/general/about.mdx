title: 'About Skate AVS'
---

<Note>
  This document is intended for [EigenLayer Operator](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-introduction) and requires understanding of [EigenLayer AVS](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/avs-guides/avs-developer-guide)

  Additionally, a general understanding of [Skate architecture](/main/architecture/skate) is assumed.
</Note>

## Preliminary

Skate AVS utilizes EigenLayer restaked assets to ensure the economic security of all cross-chain actions. The AVS is responsible for verifying AVS tasks, which are bundled calldata and necessary information for [Skate executors](/main/architecture/execution-network) to settle cross-chain transactions. The AVS verified data output is then signed by the [Skate relayer](/main/architecture/execution-network)] before it is ready to be executed. In other words, Skate AVS pre-confirms data, hence the name AVS.

## Design

Please refer to the [Skate AVS](/main/architecture/avs) for a detailed discussion of Skate AVS design.

## Source code

Skate uses [Othentic's stack](/operators/general/othentic), the contracts code is not availble for public at the moment.

<Note>
  Though the code is not public, architecture and attestation framework can be found at [https://othentic.gitbook.io/main/avs-framework/smart-contracts/othentic-bls-obls](https://othentic.gitbook.io/main/avs-framework/smart-contracts/othentic-bls-obls)

<Note>
  Off-chain AVS services code will be publicly available at [https://github.com/Skate-org] before mainnet. For now, stay tune for more update!
</Note>

## Rewards structure

We are working on finalizing the rewards structure. Detailed will be discussed once our PoC for public go live.

## Operator requirements

All Skate AVS operators must be a registered EigenLayer Operator. In addition, the operator need to register to Skate AVS contracts.

The hardware requirements will be dependent on the role of operator. Refers to operator [roles](/operators/roles) section for further details
