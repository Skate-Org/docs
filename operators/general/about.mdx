title: "EigenCloud AVS Overview"

<Note>
  This document is intended for [EigenLayer Operator](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-introduction) and requires understanding of [EigenLayer AVS](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/avs-guides/avs-developer-guide)

Additionally, a general understanding of [Skate architecture](/main/architecture/skate) is assumed.

## What is EigenCloud, Othentic?

The **Skate** architecture secures its core multi-chain operations using an **Actively Validated Service (AVS)** named **EigenCloud**, which is powered by the **Othentic AVS framework**. This integration allows Skate to leverage the **pooled economic security of Ethereum Restaking** to establish a verifiable, trust-minimized execution layer.

- **EigenCloud:** This is the name for Skate's AVS. Its primary function is to **provide verifiable, finality-ready proof of execution for a bundle of Skate tasks** destined for the same target chain, allowing for batched, trust-minimized multi-chain transaction settlement. It achieves this by creating a single, cryptographically secure **Merkle Root** to represent the integrity of the batch.

- **Othentic:** This is the underlying AVS framework that provides the foundational tooling (CLI, governance, and attestation contracts) to manage the AVS. It is responsible for collecting the validated **`AvsProofData`** (which includes the Merkle Root) from Aggregators and submitting it to the on-chain `AttestationCenter`.

The combined system ensures that complex, cross-chain state management, which is crucial for the Stateless AMM's unified liquidity, is secured by a dedicated, economically-bonded set of verifiers.

## Security Model (Restaking, Slashing)

The security is rooted in the **EigenLayer restaking model**, extending Ethereum's trust layer to Skate's custom validation logic.

- **Restaking:** Operators secure their role by restaking ETH/LSTs, providing **capital collateral** against misbehavior.

- **Slashing:** Malicious activity results in a loss of this collateral. It is enforced for critical security breaches involving the validation proof: **attesting to or aggregating an invalid Merkle Root** for a batch of Skate Tasks, or for providing a fraudulent Merkle proof to attest to the inclusion of a task that was never legitimately executed/submitted. Any failure to correctly run the core integrity checks (e.g., `hashSkateTask` or `buildMerkleTree`) is a violation of the AVS's service contract.

## AVS Operators

**AVS Operators are decentralized participants** who run the specialized node software required to provide security for the EigenCloud AVS.

**Roles & Components:** Operators are required to run several core services:

- **Performer Node (`/performer`):** Retrieves individual `SkateTask` messages from the `Skate MessageBox` and bundles them based on destination chain (`chainId/vmType`) constraints.

- **Attester Node:** Performs the local validation, primarily by calculating the **Task Hashes** and constructing the **Merkle Tree** for the bundle using the `constructProofFromTaskBundle` logic.

- **Aggregator Node:** Collects and aggregates the resulting `AvsProofData` (including the Merkle Root) from Attesters, verifies consensus, and submits the final encoded proof data (`encodeTaskDataMapForSolidity`) to the Othentic smart contract.

- **Tracking:** Operator activity and AVS health can be tracked via the AVS Dashboard (`/dashboard`).

The hardware requirements will be dependent on the role of operator. Refers to operator [roles](/operators/roles) section for further details.

## Economic Security Guarantees

The Economic Security Guarantees quantify the trust provided to Skate users.

- **Pooled Security:** The total value of ETH restaked ensures a high **Cost of Corruption**, making a hostile takeover uneconomical.

- **Slashing-Based Guarantee:** The security commitment is to maintain sufficient restaked capital to penalize any fraudulent proof submission. This target is calibrated to **secure the aggregate liquidity of the Stateless AMM against invalid cross-chain state updates and fraudulent settlement claims, ensuring the finality and integrity of all cross-VM trades and the unified liquidity model**.

## Source Code

Skate uses [Othentic's stack](/operators/general/othentic), the contracts code is not available for public at the moment.
