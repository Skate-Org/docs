### About us

The Skate core contributors are veteran blockchain engineers and quantitative researchers, previously from Altonomy, Bybit, Certik, Citi, Point72, ...

During our time at Altonomy, we facilitated $20b+ OTC trading volume and performed market making across various asset classes.

Leveraging our background in traditional finance and crypto markets, we built Range Protocol, an Automated Liquidity Management platform
to enable users to optimize yield by deploying their capital on concentrated liquidity AMM pools across major EVM chains.
Range achieved $30M+ TVL and launched on 15+ chains within just 5 months, from May to October 2023 during the bear market.

### Our vision for Skate

While building Range, we faced recurring challenges in:

1. Fragmented liquidity
2. Repeated audits
3. Significant developer overhead with every new chain deployment.

These recurring issues stem from the core problem of Application Fragmentation that is plaguing many protocols today.

As the L2 ecosystem grows and altVM L1s like SolanaVM and TonVM gain traction, these inefficiencies have only become more pronounced. 
To solve this, **Skate** - the infrastructure that unifies application states across EVM chains and altVM environments -- was born. 
Skate eliminates the need for repeated deployments and fragmented liquidity, enabling applications to scale efficiently while focusing on innovation 
and user experience.

Our ultimate vision with Skate is to let users interact with applications across any VM, all while staying on their preferred chain.
