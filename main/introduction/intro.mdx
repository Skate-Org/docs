title: "Skate: Infrastructure for Stateless Applications"
---

Skate is infrastructure that enables applications to operate as stateless entities across multiple blockchains simultaneously. Think of it like Instagram, which runs on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows as a single cohesive application.

In traditional Web2 architecture, applications follow a client-server model. Instagram's core logic and user data live on servers. The application adapts and deploys across different client platforms, each with its own UI and platform-specific handling, but all clients interact with the same backend state. The user's feed, DMs, and follower graph exist once, centrally, regardless of which device they're using.

Skate brings this proven architectural pattern to blockchain. It enables a single application to maintain unified state on a hub chain while deploying lightweight client contracts (periphery) across Solana, Ethereum, Sui, and other virtual machines. All components operate in concert as one cohesive system.

## Stateless Applications: The Pattern

A stateless application decouples core business logic and canonical state from execution and settlement concerns.

**The Kernel (Hub Chain, or "Server")**
- Maintains the single source of truth for application state
- Executes all core business logic
- Enforces protocol invariants and safety guarantees
- Generates deterministic task outputs describing state updates

**The Periphery (Spoke Chains, or "Clients")**
- Handles user-facing interactions on individual blockchains
- Manages local asset custody and user onboarding
- Stages user intents (actions) for processing on the kernel
- Receives task callbacks and finalizes execution results
- Maintains no core state. It is purely a reflection of hub-chain truth

## How Execution Flows

1. **User Action on Spoke Chains**: A user interacts with a periphery contract on their preferred blockchain (Solana, Ethereum, Sui) and creates an Action. This Action describes the user's intent for what they want to do.

2. **Executor Relay to Kernel**: The Execution Network listens to periphery contracts across all chains and picks up these Actions. Executors relay them to the kernel contracts deployed on the hub chain.

3. **Kernel Processing**: The kernel validates the Action against canonical state and applies the application's core business logic. If the action requires effects on other chains (such as settling a swap), the kernel produces a Task. This Task describes the exact state update and settlement requirements.

4. **Task Attestation**: The EigenCloud AVS operators review the Task and attest to its correctness. Once the attestations reach sufficient quorum, the task is considered validated.

5. **Task Settlement on Spoke Chains**: After achieving quorum, the validated Task is settled via callbacks on the destination periphery chains. Assets are transferred and local views update to match kernel truth.

The result: a truly omnichain application where users remain on their preferred blockchain while accessing applications designed for unified, cross-chain operation. No bridging complexity. No liquidity fragmentation. One canonical state.
