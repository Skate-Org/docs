1. **Rollup**<br/> 
  A rollup is a layer 2 scaling solution for blockchain networks that aims to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees. It works by performing state transition on a specialized blockchain then submitting a single proof of the state delta back to Ethereum mainnet.

1. **Data Availability Layer**<br/> 
  Data Availability (DA) Layer ensure that transaction data is available and accessible as needed. It is responsible for storing and serving the data needed to reconstruct the state of the blockchain. More details on [how Skate use DA](/main/blockchain/avail)

1. **Actively Validated Services (AVS)**<br/>
  Actively Validated Service (AVS) is any system that requires its own distributed validation semantics for verification, such as sidechains, data availability layers, new virtual machines, keeper networks, oracle networks, bridges, threshold cryptography schemes, and trusted execution environments. At Skate, we build an AVS (the Skate Preconfirmation AVS) to validate execution data for cross-chain settlements. More details on [Skate Preconfirmation AVS](/main/architecture/avs)

1. **Kernel**<br/>
  Skate Kernel is a part of a Skate stateless app. They contains shared state and responsible for managing the unified state and executing essential logic. [Kernel docs](/main/architecture/kernel)

1. **Periphery**<br/>
  Skate Periphery is a part of a Skate stateless app. They are entry point that end user interact with, responsible for arbitrary logic. All periphery implementations must reference the kernel for the shared state. [Periphery docs](/main/architecture/kernel)

1. **MessageBox**<br/>
   The contract on Skate chain that defines interface for all Skate Apps to register user intent and corresponding tasks for execution. All user intents must be registered in MessageBox before execution. MessageBox is a part of [Skate Kernel](/main/architecture/kernel)

1. **Skate Gateway**<br/>
   The contract on each destination (periphery) chain that defines interface for all executors to settle user intents. This contract keep status of each task executed (STAGE / COMMIT / ABORT) on a specific destination chain that the contract lives on (either EVM or non-EVM). Gateway is a part of [Periphery components](/main/architecture/periphery)

1. **Execution Network**<br />
  Skate's Execution Network contains a set of executors who perform actions (or "execute tasks") to resolve user intents. The settlement can happen on any Skate's supported chain. Eventual consistency (between hub and periphery chains) is assured by default, applications with stricter consistency requirements have to encode the logic in the intent structure.
