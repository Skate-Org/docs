### What is Skate? 

Skate is an infrastructure layer that enables users to interact seamlessly from their native chains by connecting them to all VMs (EVM, TonVM, SolanaVM). For users, we provide apps that run from and in their preferred environment. For developers, we manage crosschain complexities and introduce a new application paradigm to enable apps the be built with a single application state while serving all chains and all VMs. 

### Why Skate?

Virtual Machines (VMs) are the foundation of blockchains, allowing for the execution of smart contracts and the development of decentralized applications. While the EVM pioneered virtual machines, the exponential growth of alternative VMs, such as Solana VM, Ton VM, and Move VM, is heralding a new multichain primitive for Web3. Each of these VMs offers unique value propositions and advantages, carving out and solidifying their positions in the blockchain space. 

However, despite their advantages, many of these chains remain nascent in terms of application maturity. Ethereum continues to lead the application space, maintaining the deepest liquidity and the most mature application ecosystem. For new users, accessing existing EVM applications across chains often requires cumbersome and unintuitive cross-chain navigation, creating barriers to a seamless experience. Developers face similar hurdles, as they must manage varying technical architectures, differing implementations and cross-chain integrations, adding to the complexity of app development. 

Skate wants to revolutionise user experience and developer experience by introducing an orchestration layer to connect all VMs to all users in their native environment. We want TON users to stay on TON while we facilitate interactions to other VMs such as EVM, Solana.
