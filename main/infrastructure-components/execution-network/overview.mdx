description: "How cross-chain intents are processed by Skate?"

Skate Execution Network consists of **a transaction relayer**, **a set of executors** along with **Executor Registries** on kernel and every supported chain:

1. **Executors**<br/>
  These specialized entities, either from Skate or third-party providers, handle user intents across blockchains. They must manage their own cross-chain inventories and execution plans. In exchange, they receive fees from users who need their transactions settled through Skate.

2. **Relayer**<br/>
  The relayer oversees the confirmation results from [Skate AVS](/main/architecture/avs) and attests to them by signing, effectively preparing the calldata for the executor.

3. **Executor Registry**<br/>
  The Executor Registry manages the addition and removal of executors. Skate's design ensures Consistency and Partition tolerance (CP system). As a result, an executor must register on a specific periphery chain before being allocated a related intent.
