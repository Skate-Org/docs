## Kernel Core Contracts
The kernel components are responsible for managing the **unified state** and **executing essential logic**.

1. **Message Box**
    
    A single contract that defines interface for *all Skate Apps* to register user intent and corresponding execution tasks. It serves as the entry point for creating intents, and all executors will source this contract for pending actions.
    
2. **Skate App**
    
    The base contract that all kernel implementations must inherit from. Skate App does
    
    - Transforming user intents to imperative tasks for executions.
    - Pushing relevant data into Message Box.
    - Link the kernel app to all periphery apps on destination chains.

An overview of the interaction with Kernel is shown in the diagram below:
