### Polymarket on Skate (LIVE)

In our recent pilot with Polymarket on TON and Solana, Skate revolutionizes the user experience, enabling users to interact with Polymarket as though it were natively integrated across chains. Users can **directly buy, sell and redeem winnings** **from their native chain** and **using their native wallet**. There is **no bridging** and **no crosschain interactions required from the user**.

It is evident that there are many hurdles from bridging and also managing different user accounts that may be cumbersome and difficult to navigate for new users. 

### Native User Experience

For users, we deliver a seamless, native experience, enabling them to operate with just one wallet from their native chain. For developers, we simplify the development process by allowing them to offload cross-chain interactions and management to Skate's infrastructure. Additionally, we empower their applications by introducing a unified state, eliminating redundant deployments and duplicate states, allowing developers to focus entirely on innovation rather than infrastructure management.
