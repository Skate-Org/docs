## Kernel Components

The kernel components are responsible for managing the **unified state** and **executing essential logic**.

1. **Message Box**
    
    A single contract that defines interface for *all Skate Apps* to register user intent and corresponding execution tasks. It serves as the entry point for creating intents, and all executors will source this contract for pending actions.
    
2. **Skate App**
    
    The base contract that all kernel implementations must inherit from. Skate App does
    
    - Transforming user intents to imperative tasks for executions.
    - Pushing relevant data into Message Box.
    - Link the kernel app to all periphery apps on destination chains.

An overview of the interaction with Kernel is shown in the diagram below:

```mermaid

    executor[Any Executor] -- "parse user signed intent" --> processIntent

    subgraph kernel[App Kernel]
      f0["Arbitrary application \nspecific logics"]
      state[(App Shared State)]
      subgraph skateApp[SkateApp]
        processIntent{{"ProcessIntent()"}}
      end
      processIntent -- execute --> f0
      processIntent -- stage --> state
    end
    
    processIntent -- parse intent calldata --> submitTask

    subgraph MB[Message Box]
      submitTask{{"SubmitTasks()"}}
      taskStore[("Task Store \n(pending tasks)")]

      submitTask -- update --> taskStore
      submitTask -- register --> regExecution["Task <-> Executor\n mapping"]
    end
```
</Card>

In addition, an Executor Registry will live on Skate to register actors with the capability to process user intents. For in-depth details, refer to [execution network](/main/architecture/execution-network)
