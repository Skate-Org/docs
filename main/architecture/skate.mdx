description: "An overview of skate layered architecture to solve state fragmentation"
---

Skate envisions a novel approach that enables Stateless Apps to run smoothly across both EVM and non-EVM chains, maintaining a consistent application state throughout. Instead of fragmentation due to siloed deployments on each chain, Skate uses a hub chain to manage the unified state. This innovative strategy addresses the common issues of application fragmentation and operational inefficiencies, offering a cohesive solution for blockchain applications.

## Client Server Architecture

In the realm of traditional computing, the client-server architecture has long been a foundational paradigm, celebrated for its effective resource management, scalability, and security. This model bifurcates the application into two primary components: the server, responsible for hosting and managing resources, and the client, which requests and utilizes these resources. By mirroring this architecture in the blockchain space, Skate introduces a sophisticated approach to application design.

In essence, Skate decouples the core application logic, or kernel, from user interactions, referred to as the periphery. A standard Skate's flow is managed by the following components:

1. __Nollie (EVM Hub Chain)__<br/> 
  Nollie serves as the central hub for _all kernel contracts_, managing the core application logic and maintaining the global state. The testnet is currently built with OP Plasma.

2. __Skate AVS (Eigenlayer)__<br/>
  The Skate Actively Validated Services (AVS) facilitate secure communication between the kernel and periphery components across different chains. It ensures that intents are validated before execution, maintaining consistency and security.

3. __Intent Execution Network__<br/> 
  This network facilitates the execution of user intents on kernel contracts and coordinates with periphery contracts across multiple chains. It utilizes a decentralized group of executors to establish a competitive market for processing user intents, effectively encourage efficient and timely settlement.

A standard flow of an interaction with Skate app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Intent Creation">
    Users initiate intents on different originating chains (EVM, TON, Solana, ...). These intents specify the desired actions or outcomes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Executor Allocation">
    Through Skate infrastructures, a network of executors pick up these intents and compete to reserve for settlement of the intents. In the same time, they execute necessary logic on the kernel contract (on the Nollie chain) to update core state and logic of the application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Data Attestation">
    If the execution requires interaction or settlement between the kernel and periphery components on different chains, the AVS validates these interactions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Settlement">
    Once validated by the AVS, the chosen executor carry out relevant interactions between the kernel and the respective periphery contracts on the destination chains.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Skate's Kernel and Periphery

Skate's design aims to streamline the development and operation of Web3 applications across multiple blockchain environments. With a single Kernel, apps can maintain one state across all chains, making this approach efficient for state management, with enhanced security and seamless cross-chain interactions.

### Kernel state

The kernel is the core component of a Stateless App, responsible for managing the unified state and executing essential logic. In the context of Skate, kernel contracts are deployed on the Nollie chain, which is based on OP Plasma stack. These contracts are written in Solidity and handle the primary application logic and state transitions

### Periphery gateway

The periphery components handle user interactions and specific functionalities on different blockchain environments. Each periphery contract is tailored to the execution semantic of the respective chain. For instance, on EVM-compatible chains, the periphery contracts are written in Solidity tailored to specific EVM variant, whereas on TON or Solana, they are written in FunC and Rust, respectively. These periphery contracts pull state from the kernel to ensure eventual consistency of user-specific actions.

## EigenLayer shared security for message relaying

In Skate, users initiate actions by creating intents, which consist of tasks to be executed on various destination chains. These intents are picked up by __[executors](#client-server-architecture)__ who compete to resolve them by interacting with the kernel hosted on Nollie chain.

To validate these interactions, all execution calldata must first be verified by the Attestation Verification System (AVS), which relies on EigenLayer stakers for economic security.

Our AVS is developed by leveraging [Othentic's stateless rollup framework](https://othentic.gitbook.io/main/stateless-rollup-framework). In depth details will be discussed in [Skate AVS](/main/architecture/avs) section
