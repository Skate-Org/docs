Skate provides SDKs for interacting with the **Skate AMM** across multiple chains:

- **Kernel SDK (core logic)** — [@skate-org/skate-app-amm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skate-org/skate-app-amm)
- **Sui Periphery SDK** — [@skate-org/skate_amm_sui_sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skate-org/skate_amm_sui_sdk)
- **Solana Periphery SDK** — [@skate-org/skate_amm_solana](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skate-org/skate_amm_solana)

These SDKs enable traders, bots, and market makers to quote and execute swaps directly on Skate AMM’s **unified liquidity layer**. Please refer to the respective repos for the most updated changes and documentation.
