## Boosted Range

Boosted ranges are highly concentrated liquidity zones where demand peaks for certain pools on specific chains. 

We give out incentive to provide deeper liquidity for these ranges. 
The **displayed boosted APY** is an estimation using current mark price of rewards token per unit of liquidity value provided in the boosted range
Rewards for boosted ranges are distributed by the Skate Foundation.

For example, all LPs for the __SOL/USDC 5 bps__ pool within the __65 â€“ 585 USDC per SOL__ range will be eligible for additional rewards.

## Claim Boosted Rewards

Boosted rewards for eligible wallet can be claimed by **clicking the bell button at the top right corner** of [amm.skatechain.org](https://amm.skatechain.org)
